Governance
----------

The permanent **Technical Committee** (**TC**) of the **DINA Consortium** (**DC**) coordinates software development among the DINA Core Members to produce a coherent software system fulfilling the requirements and needs of Members. Each Core Member elects one representative to the TC and may replace its representative at any time by informing the **International Steering Committee** (**ISC**). The following guidelines are presented from the [DINA Memorandum of Understanding](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16746934/DINA__MoU.pdf).

- 6.2 Under the general guidelines set out by the ISC, the TC is expected to manage the long-term system architecture roadmap and technology choices, as well as the shortterm coordination of the development efforts.
- 6.3 The TC elects among its members a chair, who is expected to organize the work and for reporting back to the ISC.
- 6.4 In the TC, each Member has one vote. The TC meets on a regular basis, and organizes its work in the way that best suits the goal of developing and maintaining the system components efficiently.
- 6.5 The TC should strive to reach consensus but may take decisions based on a two-thirds majority if reaching consensus is not possible. Decisions are documented in minutes.
- 6.6 The TC should be transparent and open, and publish the created documents online. These include descriptions on how the DINA system works, meeting minutes, decisions, development tasks and all technical documents guiding the software development. Technical documents may include roadmaps and technical specifications of services and interfaces, as well as manuals for users and administrators. The documents need to be kept up-to-date and/or versioned appropriately.
- 6.7 The TC should find technical solutions promoting efficient distributed and modular development and drawing from the skills of each of the participating developer teams.
- 6.8 The TC should respect the priorities of each of the Core Members participating in the development effort while keeping an eye on the overall priorities of the DC.
- 6.9 The TC assigns development tasks to each of the Core Member teams, and sets up an appropriate timeframe for delivery in communication with that team.
- 6.10 Each development team is expected to finish its tasks on time according to the TC specifications. The TC is expected to have the finished software component tested and approved for inclusion in the system. A task is not considered completed until it has been approved by the TC.
- 6.11 Each partner in the consortium is expected to administer its system installation(s) and for supporting its user community.
