Governance
----------

The **DINA Consortium** (**DC**) is governed by an **International Steering Committee** (**ISC**) comprised of volunteers, who are selected by and represent Members. The ISC oversees the pursuit of goals, priorities, and activities proposed by Members. The ISC will focus this effort by identifying key agendas, directing work, sharing information, raising funds, and monitoring outcomes. The ISC reviews prospective members and membership status changes using DC membership and Member responsibilities (presented below from the [DINA Memorandum of Understanding](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16746934/DINA__MoU.pdf)) as criteria.

- 5.2 The ISC elects among itself a chair and a secretary, and will meet at least twice a year, using web conferencing solutions if appropriate. The ISC should maintain a DC web site.
- 5.3 The ISC will make sure that DC goals are achieved through the work of task forces made up of volunteers who are selected by and represent the Members. DC task force members will have capabilities and resources to offer DC. New task forces and new task force members may be proposed by Members to the ISC for review and approval at any time.
