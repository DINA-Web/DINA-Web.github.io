Vision & Mission
----------------

Our vision is an interoperable digital information system for natural science that advances research, conservation efforts, and public understanding of the natural world.

Our mission is to build and maintain an open-source, standards-based digital information system for the natural sciences where organizations and experts share in its development and success.

Data Standards
--------------

<img width="100%" alt="DINA Standards" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c4d0cf-00e1-43d3-9d0c-878e3feed538" class="img-fluid">

DINA is standards-compliant from metadata to material samples to their derived data products such as DNA sequences and multimedia.
